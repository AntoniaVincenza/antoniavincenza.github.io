# Material Calculations

## Netherlands Plaster Production Potential

### Question: 
How much plaster can be made from the 60 million tons of yearly cow manure in the Netherlands?

### Plaster Recipe Used:
- 1 part clay
- 3 parts cow manure  
- 2.5 parts sand
- **Total**: 6.5 parts

### Calculation:

**Cow manure portion:**
3 ÷ 6.5 = 0.4615 or ~46.15%

**Total tons of plaster possible:**
60,000,000 tons ÷ 0.4615 = **130,000,000 tons**

**Volume conversion:**
Assuming average plaster density of 1,600 kg/m³:
(130,000,000 tons × 1000 kg/ton) ÷ 1600 kg/m³ = **81,250,000 m³**

### Area Coverage Potential

**With 7mm plaster thickness:**
81,250,000 m³ ÷ 0.007 m = **11,607,142,857 m²**

## Summary

With annual cow manure production of 60 million tons in the Netherlands, approximately:
- **130 million tons** of plaster could be produced
- **81.25 million cubic meters** of plaster volume
- **11.6 billion square meters** could be covered at 7mm thickness

This demonstrates the enormous potential for utilizing agricultural waste in construction applications.

## Regional Material Availability

The Netherlands has diverse soil types suitable for plaster production:
- **Loam** - ideal binding properties
- **Clay** - structural strength  
- **Sand** - texture and workability
- Regional variations allow for locally optimized recipes
