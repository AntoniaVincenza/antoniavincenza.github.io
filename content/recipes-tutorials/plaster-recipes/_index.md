## Finishes

**Dung Slurry:**

**Application:**
A water-resistant shell can be made by creating a slurry. Cowdung is mixed with water to form a paste and then applied on top of plasters and floors.

**Warning:**
If applied carelessly, it can result in mechanical weathering and decay of the crust.

**Double boiled linseed oil:**

Take a brush or spray bottle and slowly apply the oil. The material will absorb it quite fast. You
will need to apply multiple layers to avoid stains.
Appearance: Very dark compared to other finishing methods.
Waterproof Ability: High - recommended for areas that are exposed to a lot of water
Price: €€
