## Dung Slurry for Waterproofing

**Application:**
A water-resistant shell can be made by creating a slurry. Cowdung is mixed with water to form a paste and then applied on top of plasters and floors.

**Warning:**
If applied carelessly, it can result in mechanical weathering and decay of the crust.
