# Production Concepts

Verschiedene Ansätze für die Produktion und Logistik nachhaltiger Baumaterialien.

## Individual Production On Site

### Process:
1. **Farm supplies** surplus cow manure
2. **Excavation site** provides clay + sand  
3. **Logistics** coordinate material transport
4. **On-site mixing** at construction location

### Advantages:
- Local production on demand
- Reduced transport emissions
- Flexible quantities

### Disadvantages:  
- No existing system infrastructure
- Complex logistics coordination
- Multiple transport requirements

## Small Production On Farm

### Process:
1. **Farm** processes surplus cow manure
2. **Local materials**: premade clay mix OR own excavated clay + sand
3. **On-farm processing**: Mix & dry plaster
4. **Distribution** via retail to construction sites

### Advantages:
- Less permits needed
- Reduced logistics complexity  
- Farmers can sell value-added products
- Short process = less ammonia emissions

### Disadvantages:
- No existing system infrastructure
- If dried, plaster loses some waterproofing properties

## Large Scale Production

### Process:
1. **Centralized collection** of farm surplus manure
2. **Industrial processing** at dedicated facilities
3. **Quality control** and standardization
4. **Distribution** through existing retail networks

### Advantages:
- Works within existing systems
- Big scale solution potential
- Easy for farmers to participate
- Standardized quality

### Disadvantages:
- Requires extensive permits
- More complex logistics
- Longer process = more emissions (ammonia + methane)
- Higher infrastructure investment

## Stakeholder Integration

Each production model involves different stakeholders:
- **Farmers** (manure suppliers)
- **Logistics companies** (transport)
- **Processing companies** (manufacturing)
- **Retailers** (distribution)
- **Contractors** (application)
- **Clients** (end users)
- **Architects** (specification)

The choice of production model affects the entire value chain and regulatory requirements.
